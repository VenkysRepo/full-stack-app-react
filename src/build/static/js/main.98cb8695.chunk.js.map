The phone is an impressive smartphone from the Sony Experia stables and similar to its predecessors, comes in the form of a bar. The device is run on the well tested Android v2.3 OS, upgradable to v4.1 Jelly Bean, and can also be upgraded to the much vaunted v4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) OS. The Sony Xperia P possesses a 1 GHz U8500, Dual Core processor. These specifications are supported by a 1 GB RAM to assure the smooth running of the multiple apps on this device.\n\n            The rectangular screen of this Sony phone is a 4-inch TFT capacitive display, which gives a resolution of 960 x 540 pixels. The display also comes with WhiteMagic Technology, which is a feature that allows the user to discern what is displayed on the screen even in the afternoon sun and helps to conserve battery at other times. Additionally, the Mobile Bravia Engine aids the display quality to a fair extent. The User Interface used on this device is Android’s very own Timescape.\n            \n            The phone possesses a powerful 8 megapixel camera with an 8x digital zoom which will ensure excellent quality pictures. The secondary 0.3 megapixel camera allows the user to carry out video calls. The camera is accompanied with an LED flash. The camera features Face and Smile detection, Touch Focus, Image Stabilization, Red-eye Reduction and many more features that simplify the photography process. The Full HD recording feature on the device is capable of taking high definition 1080 x 1920 pixel video, at 30 fps, making the video shooting experience quite satisfying. The phone comes loaded with a geo-tagging feature that allows a user to obtain local information using the GPS function on the phone.\n            \n            Design\n            \n            The Sony Experia P has a good weight distribution and is easy to hold in the palm of the hand. The edges are sharp and straight in appearance. The phone weighs in at 120 g and is neither too light nor too heavy when held. The screen is scratch resistant and has a shatter proof sheet over the mineral glass. The display comes with an ambient light sensor which is an intelligent sensor that adjusts the display brightness according to the surrounding environment.\n            \n            Storage and Battery\n            \n            The Sony Experia P comes with a sufficient internal memory of 16 GB. The colossal processor requires an equally efficient battery. The device comes packed with a 1305 mAh, Li-Ion battery which takes care of the power requirements of the device. The battery promises to offer 6 hours of talktime when used on the 2G network and offers an equally adequate 5 hours when used on the 3G spectrum. The device offers up to 80 hours of music playback and 4 hours of video playback to keep you entertained when travelling or when you’re sitting in an extremely boring meeting. Headphones are advisable for the latter case.\n            \n            Connectivity and Features\n            \n            This Sony Experia will keep you connected in almost all the possible ways. Over the 2G network you can use GPRS and EDGE technology. For an optimized browsing experience the user can also connect to the internet via the 3G network. The device is capable of higher data transfer rates being HSDPA and HSUPA capable. That means the capacity of the phone to transfer data is enhanced compared to other 3G capable phones without this feature. This Sony phone is also WiFi capable when you are in a wireless network. The user can also transfer files and documents through Bluetooth or through the micro USB port. The device is capable of tethering to other mobiles through the USB and WiFi hotspot. Using the HDMI port on the device the user can connect and transfer audio or video data from this phone.\n            This Sony phone caters to the music lover with 3D Surround Sound and xCLOUD technology for an excellent music experience. Living up to being an all-round entertainment phone, the user can indulge in motion games like Asphalt and Tilt 3D or access the FM radio.\n            The device comes with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. Other apps such as Youtube, Google Talk with Video Chat, Google Latitude and the Android Market are bundled into this phone. Business features of the phone include Document Viewer, which allows the user to manage and access documents and presentations and Pushmail, which provides access to the user’s Email on the move.`,\n        ]\n    },    {\n        name: 'Apple iPhone 6S',\n        code: 'AppleiPhone6S',\n        price:40000,\n        imgUrl:'https://rukminim1.flixcart.com/image/832/832/j7qi9ow0/mobile/h/f/t/apple-iphone-6s-mn0x2hn-a-original-imaexw7fpbbfwwtw.jpeg?q=70',\n        description: [\n            `Apple iPhone 6s smartphone was launched in September 2015.
